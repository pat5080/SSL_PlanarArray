**Current version:** 1.0.0 

SSM\_LinearArray is a real-time SLAM library for sound sources mapping using an off-shelf robotic perception device (e.g. Kinect or PS3-Eye), which have a linear microphone array embedded inside. SSM\_LinearArray reads raw image (Mono/RGB-D), audio data and computes the camera trajectory, sound sources locations and a dense/sparse 3D reconstruction when a Kinect (**RGB-D** Camera) / PS3-Eye (**Monocular** Camera) is used.

#2. Prerequisites
I tested the library in **14.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
New thread and chrono functionalities of C++11 are used.

## Pangolin
[Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) is used for for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 2.4.3. Tested with OpenCV 2.4.11**.

## Eigen3
Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## BLAS and LAPACK
[BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas) and [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack) libraries are requiered by g2o (see below). On ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libblas-dev
sudo apt-get install liblapack-dev
```

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
Modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library are to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder. Original version of [libgp](https://github.com/mblum/libgp) is used for building microphone array sensor model using Gaussian Process.

## ROS
[ROS](ros.org) is needed to process the live input of the sensor or pre-recorded rosbag files.

## Freenect (optional)
[Freenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) library is needed for live processing of kinect microphone array. In this case, once the freenect library is compiled, copy the libfreenect.so into *ROS/SSM_LinearArray/lib* folder. A precompiled libfreenect.so file under Ubuntu 14.04 is already included, so if it matches your version of OS, probably it's enough to go.

## PyAudio (optional)
[Pyaudio](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyAudio) library is needed for live processing of PS3-Eye microphone array. On Ubuntu, pyaudio can be installed by:
```
sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio
```

#3. Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:daobilige-su/SSM_LinearArray.git
```

A script `build.sh` is to build the *Thirdparty* libraries and *SSM\_LinearArray*. Please make sure you have installed all required dependencies (see section 2). Execute:
```
cd SSM\_LinearArray
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

This will create **libSSM\_LinearArray.so**, **libcsparse_extension**  at *lib* folder and other executables in *ROS/SSM\_LinearArray/bin* folder.

#4. Run

## Running the pre-recorded data
In the case of Kinect, run the following commands in terminal:
```
roslaunch SSM_LinearArray freenectrosbag+ssmlineararray.launch 
```

In the case of PS3-Eye, run the following commands in terminal:
```
roslaunch SSM_LinearArray ps3eyerosbag+ssmlineararray.launch 
```

Open another terminal, go to the folder containing recorded rosbag files and play it by:
```
rosbag play XXX.bag
```
where XXX.bag is the recored rosbag file.

## Pre-recorded Data

An example (recorded rosbag file) of mapping 2 sound sources using Kinect can be found [here](https://mega.nz/#!LpQHQAKY!ieHMVTvn84osptAr9ib6di18QmPL1oZ0KKhQdE_CNZg)(1GB).

An example (recorded rosbag file) of mapping 5 sound sources in a computer lab using Kinect can be found [here](https://mega.nz/#!y4IUxQCB!thKCMAWGZkldkY6_69L17JrLqe6m_KGRecLCtEbWV2o) (3.36GB)

An example (recorded rosbag file) of mapping 2 sound sources using PS3-Eye can be found [here](https://mega.nz/#!ylZBDarA!3UDHWc7NuGv22Y-9N9evUUQaYrJezrZISFW1Op72M2M) (2.87GB).

If you find the system is running a bit slow, decompress the rosbag files above first.

## Running with live data
In the case of Kinect, the freenect firmware needed to be loaded to Kinect first. For details, have a look at instructions related audio data at [Freenect](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect) library. The firmware needed to loaded each time Kinect is reconnected to PC.
Then, run the following commands in terminal:
```
roslaunch SSM_LinearArray freenect+ssmlineararray.launch 
```

In the case of PS3-Eye, run the following commands in terminal:
```
roslaunch SSM_LinearArray ps3eye+ssmlineararray.launch 
```
  
#5. Processing your own sequences
Need to change the setting files with the calibration of your sensor. The setting files are inside the folder *ROS/SSM\_LinearArray/config*. The calibration model of OpenCV is used for camera calibration. 

#6. To use other sound sources Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation algorithms
In this implementation, SRP-PHAT is used for the sound source DOA estimation. The microphone array transfer function is based on geometric locations of microphones. For those who want to achieve better DOA estimation accuracy, the pre-recoded transfer function of the microphone array should be used instead of the geometric locations of microphones. In this case, we recommend using [HARK](http://www.hark.jp/) to estimation DOA angle using the pre-recorded transfer function. The installation and usage of HARK can be found on the [HARK online documentation](http://www.hark.jp/wiki.cgi?page=HARK+Documentation).

To use another sound source DOA estimation algorithm (HARK as an example), the HARK ROS node should subscribe to the topic "/microphone\_array\_raw" which publishes raw multi channel audio data. Then, pulish the DOA likelihood w.r.t. each angle to the topic "/srp\_phat\_fd\_value". You can rename the output ROS topic name to something more meaningful in you case.
